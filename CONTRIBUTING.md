## 📜 Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🔄 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## 🔍 Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of changes
3. You may merge the Pull Request once you have:
   - The sign-off of two other developers
   - Squashed your commits into a single commit
   - Added tests that prove your fix is effective or feature works

## 🎨 Style Guide

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Run these commands before committing:

```bash

```

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use TypeScript for new features
